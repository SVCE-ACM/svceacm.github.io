For over 25 years, Interrupt has always kept students on their toes, eagerly waiting to experience its thrill and grandeur. This year, on the 29th of September, Technofair was conducted as a part of the SVCE-ACM Student Chapter initiative – an event where the participants are provided with a certain number of points as soon as they register, enabling them to trade their points to participate in the various mini events, thereby grabbing the chance to gain more points and win exciting goodies. <br><br>Technofair had a total of 10 exciting mini events, each of them being unique in their own special way. Having such a wide plethora of fun-filled technical events, Technofair gave its participants a wide variety of opportunities to choose from. While events tend to get boring and monotonous at times, this was one such event which never lost its element of excitement, which was undoubtedly the driving factor behind its huge success!</p><!-- .event-desc -->

On the 4th of September 2018, a guest lecture on Virtualization was conducted by Mr. Ashok Lakshmichandran, Founder & CEO of Futurenet Technologies. He spoke about Virtualization and cloud and its benefits. He also spoke of how Virtualization applied into real world scenarios and how students can make a career out in it highlighting Vmware's role in Virtualization. He concluded his lecture with an interactive Q&A session with the audience, thereby enabling the students to get their doubts clarified and to get a better understanding about Virtualization as a whole.

This hackathon was conducted in Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering on the 26th and 27th of August, 2017. 8 teams consisting of 2-3 members each took part in this hackathon. Each team was to make an educational app, based on riboswitches or biobrick assembly within a time period of 24 hours. Finally, each team’s app was judged by Dr. Ravi Kant from Saksin and the team which had made the best, most efficient app was awarded with a cash prize of Rs.15000. The main aim of this event was to enable the participants to collaborate and learn beyond their specialized course of curriculum.

This debate was open to 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students from all over the college. 14 people participated in this event. The main aim of this event was to ensure that students learn to stand up for themselves and for what they believe in because that’s what it takes to succeed in the corporate world. These top notch debates were well received and appreciated by a sizeable and enthusiastic audience that served as strong encouragement to all the participants. The debate had multiple rounds. The best participants were filtered out and made to debate against each other in the final round. Joshua Samuel and Chaitra emerged as the winner and the runner up. The outstanding highlight of this event was the depth of research and analysis that participants had done on their topics - they truly left no stone unturned.</p><!-- .event-desc -->

The workshop focused on LAMP Stack. The various students attending the workshop were asked to setup an apache server along with a database and were taught the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL with the help of simple, crisp examples. Bootstrap Framework was discussed elaborately since it is one of the most commonly used frameworks for building a responsive website. The workshop also touched upon various other concepts in a more theory oriented way such as Ajax for asynchronous server requests, hosting/deployment of a website and various other languages currently being used in the industry. A Portfolio Website was prepared to demonstrate the interaction between the frontend and backend of Web development thereby enabling the participants to get a hands on experience.</p><!-- .event-desc -->

                                <p class="event-desc">The Hour of Code is a global movement designed to generate excitement in young people about programming and technology. Games, tutorials, and other events are organized during the Computer Science Education Week every year between December 4th and 10th. This year, the ACM Student Chapter of SVCE decided to contribute their part to this global initiative by conducting a participatory workshop in Don Bosco School on 4th December 2017. About 40 students from 9th and 10th grades attended the event. An interactive tutorial (from the hourofcode.com) which focuses on the basics of Python, was used to ensure a great learning experience for the students. It had a chatter bot, named Eliza, explain the basic concepts of Python such as input, print and loop statements. The students then tried their hand at coding with some guidance from the ACM volunteers. The students were more than just excited with the tutorial sessions and the hands on experience. They participated passionately and gained reasonable expertise on the fundamental concepts of Python. The workshop thereby succeeded in giving students a head start for their future endeavors. They were actually able to widen their knowledge about coding and thus the essence of Hour of Code was achieved.</p><!-- .event-desc -->

The session started off with an introduction on what the blockchain is, some information about its mysterious creator and the reasoning behind its creation. He then touched on the most popular cryptocurrencies with brief explanations on each of them. The lecture included demos of the blockchain ledger system as well as a clear explanation of the hash functions involved and the concept of 'mining'. Tarun also debunked the many myths about blockchain. He then went into an in depth explanation on Merkel trees and their uses in the blockchain. It ended with an interactive Q&A session with questions involving everything from Mt. Gox to whether they should invest in cryptocurrency.</p><!-- .event-desc -->

                                <p class="event-desc">A non-technical quiz based on technological trends and facts was conducted on 16th February, 2018. It was divided into 4 different rounds. The quiz started off with the Quizmaster, Akash Saravanan explaining the rules and the format. After a trick question to put the crowd at ease, the quiz began with an energized audience. The first round consisted of questions over a variety of fields which have been in the news recently. The questions in this round related to everything from Snapchat’s recent design update and the uproar behind it to cryptocurrency millionaires, Boston Dynamics’ Spot Mini robot and the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. The second round was a logo round with 15 logos that the teams were asked to identify. This round was followed by a “Connect” round wherein the teams were presented with a series of images and were asked to connect them to a specific language, company, technology or person. The final round was an exciting 20 question round on technology, both new and old. Overall, there were 18 teams of 2 evenly spread across the 2nd and 3rd years. Ultimately, CoreML consisting of Gurudutt P. and Chran S. of the 3rd year came out as the winner by a narrow margin. The event was a very informational and exciting session for all the participants and they requested more quizzes to be conducted. A majority of the participants praised the selection of questions and stated that they acquired new knowledge that they wouldn’t have normally encountered.</p><!-- .event-desc -->

A total of 29 girls participated in this tech game, who were split up into 10 teams. The main aim of this event was to encourage women to explore the depths of technology in the most fun-filled way possible. All of the teams participated with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. In the end, the team consisting of Adela Florence, Brammi.J and Dhivya.R from 2nd year, CSE-A emerged as the winning team. This was a fun-filled tech event which pushed people to not only use their tech knowledge, but also their wit and presence of mind.</p><!-- .event-desc -->
